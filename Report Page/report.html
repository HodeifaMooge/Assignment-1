        <h2>My Overall Experience</h2>
        <p>During the course of this semester, I have found web development to be quite enjoyable. I think that all the techniques and everything else is very useful and I definitely want to further develop my skills in this module.</p>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>I decided to choose a green background with red text for my pages. I chose this because according to the source I found online, I saw that red and green are two colours that compliment each other well, and I liked how they looked when I put them on my web pages.</p>

        <h2>My Overall Experience</h2>
        <p>During the course of this semester, I have found web development to be quite enjoyable. I think that all the
            techniques and everything else is very useful and I definitely want to further develop my skills in this
            module. At some stages, I did come across issues with my website, such as the grid layout not working
            properly and some of thinthe colours that needed changing, but in general, I have enjoyed this module so far
            and I want to take it further.</p>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>One of the decisions that I made on my website design was to use separate CSS files for each of the web
            pages. This was because to get the different layouts, I didn't want to use a single CSS file that would link
            to all of the HTML pages. In doing this, I can edit each CSS file separately without accidentally changing
            anything in the other pages, and I found this approach easier for this assignment.</p>
        <h2>How I Chose My Fonts/Colours</h2>
        <p>I decided to choose a green background with red text for my pages. I chose this because according to the
            source I found online, I saw that red and green are two colours that compliment each other well, and I liked
            how they looked when I put them on my web pages. Originally, I had intended to use red and black as my
            colours for my website. I didn't like it because the black made it difficult to add more content onto the
            pages. Changing it to green gave me more creativity for my pages and it was easier for me to implement more
            content through these colours.</p>
        <h2>Sources that influenced my website's design</h2>
        <p>I used this image as a source for my contact forms. I liked the look of the layout of these forms. I wanted
            to follow a similar kind of structure to this contact page because I thought that the positions of each form
            worked well and it was a good reference for my own contact page. One change I did make to my own was the
            select box. Instead of subject, I changed it to title of the person entering their info because I thought
            that it would describe the user more specifically, and the subject of the message could be summarised in the
            text area, where the message will be.</p>
        <img src="contact layout source.gif" alt="">
        <p>This was another source and this was for my navigation. I chose this one to refer to for my own navigation
            because I liked the colours that were use, and the navigation being on top of the page. I thought that the
            combination of colours was nice and I wanted to layout my nav bar at the top of the pages as well. Again,
            like the source above, I made a change for my own page. Specifically in the colours, to red and blue to keep
            the colour scheme of my website.

        <h2>My Overall Experience</h2>
        <p>During the course of this semester, I have found web development to be quite enjoyable. I think that all the techniques and everything else is very useful and I definitely want to further develop my skills in this module. At some stages, I did come across issues with my website, such as the grid layout not working properly and some of the colours that needed changing, but in general, I have enjoyed this module so far and I want to take it further.</p>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>One of the decisions that I made on my website design was to use separate CSS files for each of the web pages. This was because to get the different layouts, I didn't want to use a single CSS file that would link to all of the HTML pages. In doing this, I can edit each CSS file separately without accidentally changing anything in the other pages, and I found this approach easier for this assignment.</p>
        <h2>How I Chose My Fonts/Colours</h2>
        <p>I decided to choose a green background with red text for my pages. I chose this because according to the source I found online, I saw that red and green are two colours that compliment each other well, and I liked how they looked when I put them on my web pages. Originally, I had intended to use red and black as my colours for my website. I didn't like it because the black made it difficult to add more content onto the pages. Changing it to green gave me more creativity for my pages and it was easier for me to implement more content through these colours.</p>
